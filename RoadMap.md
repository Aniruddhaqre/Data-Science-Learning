---
Great — let’s kick this off **today** and make sure you progress fast, without raising suspicion at work, and build a strong public presence.

---

# ✅ Step 1 — Build Your Twitter Profile (10–15 minutes)

Here’s a ready-to-copy bio + profile setup:

### ✅ Twitter Bio

```
Learning Machine Learning & Analytics in public.
Building small projects | Python, SQL, ML, GA4, BigQuery, Looker Studio.
Documenting wins, failures, experiments. #100DaysOfML
```

### ✅ Profile Name

`Aniruddha | Learning ML in Public`

### ✅ Banner Text (if you want to add later)

* "Learning ML in Public"
* "Road to Data Science"
* "Building 12 Projects in 12 Weeks"

### ✅ First Tweet (Post Today)

```
Starting today, I'm learning Machine Learning in public.

Goal: Build small analytical + ML projects and improve every week.

If you're learning too, happy to connect.
#100DaysOfML #DataScience
```

Done — your Twitter is active.

Tomorrow, you will post a small learning update.

---

# ✅ Step 2 — Safe LinkedIn Positioning (So your HOD won’t panic)

Change your mindset from:

❌ "I’m becoming an ML engineer"
✅ "I’m leveling up my analytics skills to build smarter insights & automation"

This is **undetectable** as a career switch.

---

# ✅ First LinkedIn Post (Post Today)

Here’s a safe, professional one:

```
Today I’m starting a structured learning journey to improve my analytics skillset.

I’m working through Python + Machine Learning fundamentals to understand:
✅ Better predictive insights
✅ Customer behavior modelling
✅ Data-driven decision automation

I’ll be sharing what I learn — simple explanations, experiments, and small projects.

If anyone else is learning similar things, let’s connect and grow together.
```

✅ No mention of switching jobs
✅ Sounds like professional upskilling
✅ Safe and respectful

---

# ✅ Step 3 — Accelerated Roadmap (3 Months Instead of 6)

If 6 months feels slow, we can compress it into **12 weeks**.

### **Weekly Time Required**

* Weekdays: 2 hours/day (10 hrs)
* Weekends: 4 hours/day (8 hrs)
  **Total: 18 hours/week** — enough for aggressive progress.
