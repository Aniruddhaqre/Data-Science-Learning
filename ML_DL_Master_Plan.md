# End-to-End ML/DL Master Plan (5 Projects)

This roadmap will take you from beginner → job-ready in ML/DL (technical + business).

---

## **Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews (Text ML)**
**Goal**: Predict positive/negative sentiment from reviews.  

**Focus**:
- Data scraping + ETL  
- EDA (text cleaning, word frequency, TF-IDF, embeddings)  
- Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LSTMs, Transformers  
- Business ROI: How review analysis improves sales + reduces churn.  

**Why**: Covers NLP basics, text preprocessing, and classification.  

---

## **Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction (Tabular ML)**
**Goal**: Predict whether a customer will leave a subscription service.  

**Focus**:
- Feature engineering (categorical encoding, feature scaling)  
- Statistical tests (Chi-square, ANOVA)  
- Tree-based models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- Business ROI: Quantify revenue saved from retaining customers.  

**Why**: Tabular ML is the backbone of real business ML use-cases.

## **Project 3: Image Classification – Medical Imaging (DL)**
**Goal**: Detect diseases (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer) from medical scans.  

**Focus**:
- Data augmentation, CNNs, transfer learning  
- Model evaluation (precision, recall, ROC-AUC, sensitivity-specificity trade-offs)  
- Business POV: Regulatory requirements, cost of false negatives.  

**Why**: Teaches CV fundamentals + high-stakes ML decision making.  

---

## **Project 4: Demand Forecasting (Time Series ML)**
**Goal**: Forecast product demand for inventory optimization.  

**Focus**:
- Time series decomposition, stationarity, ARIMA, Prophet, LSTMs  
- Seasonality/trend detection, feature creation (lag, rolling mean)  
- Business ROI: Optimizing stock levels, reducing inventory cost.  

**Why**: Teaches forecasting + connects deeply to ROI.  

---

## **Project 5: ML-Powered Recommendation System (Full Pipeline + Deployment)**
**Goal**: Build a movie/music/product recommender system.  

**Focus**:
- Collaborative filtering, Matrix Factorization, Neural Recsys  
- End-to-end pipeline (ETL → ML → API → Docker → Cloud Deployment)  
- A/B testing for business impact measurement  
- ROI: Customer engagement uplift → revenue gain.  

**Why**: Combines technical + business + deployment → closest to production.

## ✅ After finishing these 5 projects, you’ll:
- Know the **math, statistics, and ML/DL models** in practice.  
- Have **business case + ROI articulation** skills.  
- Be able to **design, build, and deploy** ML systems end-to-end.  
- Have a **portfolio strong enough for ML/DL Engineer roles**.
