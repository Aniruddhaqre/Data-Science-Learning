# End-to-End ML & DL Project Roadmap — Technical + Business (With Complete Learning Resources)

> A **master learning roadmap** with every technical and business step broken down into sub-skills, methods, resources, and reasoning. This is designed for deep mastery by doing projects and learning every tool you’ll need along the way.

---

## 1. High-level learning approach

1. Pick 3 progressively harder projects (small, medium, capstone).
2. For each project, follow the 12-phase template (below).
3. For each phase, **study the listed concepts + resources** and apply them directly.
4. Keep an ML engineering logbook (your own wiki/notes repo).

## 6. Workflow (how to actually learn)

1. For each phase → read/watch listed resources (2–3 hrs).
2. Implement methods on your project dataset.
3. Document learnings in your logbook.
4. Move to the next phase only when deliverables are done.
